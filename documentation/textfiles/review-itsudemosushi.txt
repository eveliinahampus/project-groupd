'Some basic sushi meals' '4 stars'
Itsudemo Sushi offers a variety of sushi. Some are very traditional and some more inventive hybrid kitchen type. Always these inventions don't hit jackpot so sometimes for ordering to home a preplanned sushi set, you can get both positive and negative surprises.

Prices are decent and food is a good quality. I have never eaten in the premises, but asked husband to order something at home.
